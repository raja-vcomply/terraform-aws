# Terraform Repository

## Explanation of files and folders:

main.tf: This is the main Terraform configuration file that includes module declarations and other resources.

provider.tf: Contains the provider configuration (e.g., AWS provider configuration).

modules/: This directory contains sub-modules for different parts of your infrastructure. Each module has its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf.

variables.tf: Defines input variables used in the main configuration and modules.

outputs.tf: Defines output values from the main configuration and modules.

terraform.tfvars: Contains variable values specific to your environment. You should create this file and define values for variables in variables.tf.

.gitignore: List of files and directories to ignore when using version control (Git).

README.md: Documentation for your Terraform repository.

.terraform-version (optional): Specifies the version of Terraform to use in the repository (used by version managers like tfenv or tfswitch).

Remember that this is just a basic structure, and as your infrastructure grows, you might need to organize it further with additional modules, environments, etc.

Note: Before running Terraform commands, ensure you have the necessary credentials and access rights to your cloud provider.

To generate the repository, you can create each file and folder manually, or use a version control system like Git to manage the files and folders easily.



# My Terraform Project

This is a sample Terraform project for creating infrastructure in AWS.

## Prerequisites
